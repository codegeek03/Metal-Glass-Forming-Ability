 Metallic glass, a unique solid material, is synthesized from a liquid state without
crystallization during cooling, resulting in a non-crystalline structure with random
atomic arrangement. This material exhibits exceptional properties such as
strength, flexibility, and corrosion resistance, making it promising for various
applications. However, its susceptibility to weakening through deformation poses
a challenge.
Historically, metallic glass was first synthesized in 1960 by W. Klement Jr.,
Willens, and Duwez at Caltech, using an alloy (Au75Si25). Early formulations
required rapid cooling rates to prevent crystallization, limiting production to
specific forms like ribbons and foils. In 1969, an alloy containing palladium,
copper, and silicon demonstrated improved properties, leading to expanded
applications.
Metallic glass, synthesized without crystallization, boasts a non-crystalline
structure with exceptional properties like strength, flexibility, and corrosion
resistance. First produced in 1960, it faced challenges due to rapid cooling
requirements. Later alloys improved its properties, expanding its applications.
Despite its promise, processing hurdles remain. Yet, its unique attributes make it
invaluable in aerospace, electronics, and beyond.
